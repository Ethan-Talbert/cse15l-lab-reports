# CSE 15L Week 5 Lab Report

In this lab report we will be discussing the grep command and three different options that alter the grep command.

## A Look at the `grep` command

The grep command is used to search a file or multiple files for a specific pattern. Here is a usage without any modifications for the word "Hello" in every txt file in the technical folder.

![Image 1](images/week-5/image1.png)

As we can see, it prints the full line that matches the search term (as well as the file it came from since we are searching multiple files)

Now let's take a look at our first modification, the `-i` argument. This argument is fairly basic, it ignores case when searching for terms. When we use the same command as the example I gave above, except with the "hello" in lower case, we can see that this argument causes the same result to be printed, despite the case difference.

```
grep -i "hello" */*.txt

911report/chapter-1.txt:    At 10:39, the Vice President updated the Secretary on the air threat conference: Vice President: There's been at least three instances here where we've had reports of aircraft approaching Washington-a couple were confirmed hijack. And, pursuant to the President's instructions I gave authorization for them to be taken out. Hello?
```

This argument is very useful for when you want to search for a specific word without knowing the context it's used in. Without this argument, you could potentially exclude instances of the word being used at the beginning of sentences for example.
```
grep -i "searching" */*.txt

911report/chapter-11.txt:                to fix glaring vulnerabilities-expanding no-fly lists, searching passengers
911report/chapter-13.4.txt:            56. NSC memo, Clarke to Berger, "Post-Millennium Soul Searching," Jan. 11, 2000.
```
(Most of the output is excluded for this one, but the first two lines show the usage of `-i`)

Here's one last usage of `-i` where we search for "happiness."

```
grep -i "happiness" */*.txt

911report/chapter-11.txt:                other members of the JCS let the press know their unhappiness that, in conformity
plos/journal.pbio.0020067.txt:        happiness in newfound family life. Research gradually gave way to the pursuit of pacifist
plos/journal.pbio.0020116.txt:        Pursuit of Happiness‚Äù (http://bioethics.gov/reports/beyondtherapy/index.html) and
```

Now let's look at another modifier, the `-l` argument. This one only shows the filenames as opposed to the entire line where the search term shows up. Here's an example of this used on our original example:

```
grep -l "Hello" */*.txt

911report/chapter-1.txt
```

The output for grep suddenly becomes a lot cleaner when you are searching through a lot of different files. This is very useful for when you want to know what files contain a search term as opposed to where in each file the term is.

```
grep -l "destructive" */*.txt

911report/chapter-12.txt
911report/chapter-13.5.txt
biomed/1471-2180-2-22.txt
biomed/1471-2261-2-11.txt
biomed/ar409.txt
biomed/ar615.txt
biomed/cvm-2-1-038.txt
biomed/gb-2001-3-1-research0001.txt
biomed/gb-2003-4-5-r32.txt
plos/journal.pbio.0020054.txt
plos/journal.pbio.0020213.txt
plos/journal.pbio.0020307.txt
plos/pmed.0020033.txt
```

Do note however that all of the examples so far are looking through every file in the `technical` directory. This argument becomes a lot less useful when looking through only a few files. But for a case like this where we are looking through 1391 different txt files, it works wonderfully.

```
grep -l "unitary" */*.txt

biomed/1471-2202-3-4.txt
plos/pmed.0020247.txt
```

Our final option we will be looking at is `-n`, which prints out the line number that the search term was found at alongside everything else. Here is our original search with `-n`.

```
grep -n "Hello" */*.txt

911report/chapter-1.txt:682:    At 10:39, the Vice President updated the Secretary on the air threat conference: Vice President: There's been at least three instances here where we've had reports of aircraft approaching Washington-a couple were confirmed hijack. And, pursuant to the President's instructions I gave authorization for them to be taken out. Hello?
```

This can be a very useful option if you have large files and you want to know where exactly the insance of the search term is.

```
grep -n "happiness" */*.txt

911report/chapter-11.txt:516:                other members of the JCS let the press know their unhappiness that, in conformity
plos/journal.pbio.0020067.txt:123:        happiness in newfound family life. Research gradually gave way to the pursuit of pacifist
plos/journal.pbio.0030105.txt:28:        happiness, sadness, or anger, gave the audience insight into the variety of subtle
plos/pmed.0010052.txt:141:        support his unhappiness? Not many, and the arguments that he does offer miss the point
```

This does add more to the output, so it can be messy if you are searching through very large amounts of files.

```
grep -n "hopeless" */*.txt

911report/chapter-13.5.txt:2862:                of hopelessness among the Muslim countries and their people. They feel that they can
911report/chapter-3.txt:988:                seemed, and ultimately proved, to be a hopeless effort to persuade the Taliban
biomed/1472-684X-1-5.txt:406:          and hopelessness are inevitable and permanent
biomed/1472-684X-1-5.txt:418:          feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, and
```

This concludes our look at the grep command and the `-i`, `-l`, and `-n` options.
