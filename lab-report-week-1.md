# CSE 15L Week 1 Lab Report

In this lab report we will be discussing how to access and editing files on a remote machine through the ssh and scp terminal commands. My personal machine runs Ubuntu so that will be the perspective from which I will write this guide.

## Step 1: Installing VSCode

Our first step is to install Visual Studio Code onto our machine. All you need to do is visit [the visual studio code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and click the large download button labeled `.deb`.

After downloading the `.deb` file, navigate your terminal to the location of the downloaded file and run the command:

`sudo apt install FILE_NAME_HERE.deb`

This should install VSCode onto your computer, completing the first step.
